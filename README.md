# Pokedex

This site was for me to train basic principles of data fetching, this site specifically uses static-site-generation. 

Server rendering is able due to NextJS (version 13).

I was also experimenting with some of the Next's features like data streaming.

When building this website I learned how to handle rendering of bigger amount of data and when to use different types of renderings.

Site is fully responsive.
